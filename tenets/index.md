# Core Tenets

TravelWeft is a journey, not a destination. Conceived in reaction to growing disillusionment with the current state and trajectory of the travel industry, it is an attempt to develop and reinvent a better way for all participants in travel to interact.

On such a journey there are countless decisions to be made in relation to overall structure, governance, timing and implementation details. As we forge this new path, we hold the following beliefs as our core, guiding principles when such decisions are to be made.

## Participant owned, foundation steered

The value of an industry, or network, derives from the active participation of its members. The best way to motivate healthy participation is through ownership. Previously, cooperative-style joint ownership of an organisation has been logistically difficult and prohibitively expensive. Current technology removes those barriers.

Execution, software planning and development do not take place in a vacuum. There is an ongoing need to plan, design and implement the software which is the executable expression of the rules of the TravelWeft network. We believe this is best handled by a foundation rather than a for-profit corporate entity. In the absence of share-holder pressure, a well-funded foundation is able to take a longer-term view of network development and health than alternative structures. The foundationâ€™s role is to seed the project, and subsequently action the will of the owner-participants as exposed by the governance model of the network.

## The provider/traveller relationship belongs to the provider and traveller

Travel service providers work hard to win and service their customers. It is fitting that the relationship they develop be a direct one, not mediated by a third-party. On the other side, travellers benefit from direct interaction with service providers, and should have control over those interactions.

## Decentalized infrastructure, open software

Anybody should be able to run the TravelWeft software and participate in the network, and the network should be no more dependent on any node more than any other for its health and continuity. In this way, the network embodies the participant ownership described above and is resilient to domination or subversion by individual entities. 

An open source development model is essential to establishing a trusted platform. It is also important in enabling participation and encouraging the growth of an ecosystem which strengthens the TravelWeft network.

## Fair to providers and travellers

The greatest benefits can be seen when both sides of the travel market are treated fairly. While the participation of travel service providers is the source of value in the travel industry, that value is only realized when travellers participate too - by booking and buying. A vibrant and well-balanced travel ecosystem should therefore consider and balance the needs of both both providers and travellers at all times.
