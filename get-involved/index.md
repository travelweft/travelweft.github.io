title: Get Involved with TravelWeft - A new distributed, p2p platform for the travel industry
---

# Please Get Involved!

The vision for TravelWeft comes from almost 20 years of involvement with travel and technology, and a growing disillusionment with the state of travel tech. If what you read here strikes a chord, please get in touch and and start collaborating in forging a better travel industry - for the future of travel service providers, travellers and the societies they impact.

If you're working in technology and familiar with git/github, feel free to make a pull request with changes/additions to the above, or create an issue with topics for discussion [here](https://github.com/travelweft/travelweft.io). Otherwise, email contact to follow shortly, but in the meantime you can ping me on twitter at [@shr](https://twitter.com/shr).
