# Because We Travel

You travel. You research and book hotels. You figure out local transport. You visit attractions. You may take a tour. Or book a course. You engage with a place. You visit museums, see shows, chill in malls, dance the night away, or internailze the tranquility. You hope you get it right.

Travel is invigorating. Travel is exciting. And surprising. Travel is rewarding, on so many levels. Travel leaves us richer than we were before. Travel is transformative.

But the travel industry - the way travel products are marketed and sold, found and bought - that's a mess. Sure, it works. Kind of. Because travellers are, if nothing else, the go-getters and problem solvers of the world. But things could be so much better. From product announcement and discovery, through selection and negotiation, to deciding, buying and paying, and leaving feedback to help others, there's much room for improvement. 

We all travel. And it's time to change the way travel works for the better.

## Towards a more healthy industry

What if travel service providers had a way to list their offerings in a fair and equal marketplace? A marketplace which didn’t offer visibility based simply on how much of your revenue you’re willing to give up in commission. A marketplace where the new and the small, the specialised and the niche had a way to flourish alongside the well-established brands and long-time successful players.

What if travellers could see what was available in a destination they planned to travel to, filtered not through the greedy lens of commission-taking middlemen who privilege the few that pay the most, but through their own preferences and parameters? What if travellers had a way to ask questions of those providers and local experts in a destination, and be assured of getting honest, accurate answers without having to run the gauntlet of biased and sometimes fake reviews and advice from well-meaning but perhaps less than knowledgable outsiders.

What if providers could make offers to interested potential customers, and those customers could deal directly with said providers though a fair and open platform, with a common interface for negotiating, purchasing and leaving feedback?  What if agents could bring value where needed rather than extracting commission acrosss the board?

What if the global market was composed of regional markets, composed of local markets and so on down to the street level? And participants in those markets had a say in how things were done in their locale? Had ownership of the platform they were using? What if there was an alternative world where providers of travel were back in control of their product and sales, and no longer beholden to playing the games set up by oligarchic agencies far away?

## Introducing TravelWeft

TravelWeft is a decentralised platform for the travel industry. At its core, the platform allows travel service providers - hotels, tour  operators, transport companies, activity operators, restaurants  - to list their products on an open market place. Vendors of travel, whether that is the providers themselves, specialist agencies or listing websites, are able to query the platform for travel products and create bookings.

For travellers, the platform provides a safe and consistent travel booking experience. When a traveller makes a booking, their data is provided to the travel provider in a secure way, and all payments are made directly from traveller to provider, with no middlemen involved. Thus all bookings are direct and free of fees except for direct network costs, regardless of whether a match was initiated by the traveller orfacilitated by an agent on their behalf.

TravelWeft is a platform run for the benefit of travel industry operators. More than that, though, it is fully owned by the operators. As such participants in the platform have a direct say in how it is governed and how it evolves over time. Any member can propose improvements at a local level, and improvements with sufficient support are implemented. Communities can elect to hold back a small percentage of sales to be used in collective ventures - or redistributed as profits based on contributions to the platform success and health.

## Structural issues in the travel industry

Here are some of the systemic issues which TravelWeft hopes to address in its design, implementation and operation.

### Discovery

In a market heavily dominated by a few large OTAs and review sites operating on a commission/paid basis, only the well-established or willing-to-pay are readily discoverable by travellers. New entrants, or those not willing to sacrifice significant portions of their revenue for preferential listing, tend towards online/search invisibility. In the past, a venture may have used a strong web presence to counteract this to some extent, but that is increasingly difficult as more web content and search is subsumed by Facebook.

### Booking Experience

For those choosing to book direct, rather than through an OTA, the booking experience can be hit and miss. With limited budget and limited experience/knowledge, most smaller or newer travel ventures struggle to provide customers with a good booking and payment experience. Poor online booking flows lead to lost business, and drive even committed customers back to the major players. 

### Bundling is hard/impossible

Booking travel tends to involve managing conversations, negotiations and payments with multiple parties, all of whom have differing information requirements, policies and payment systems. Managing and coordinating these is laborious and error prone. Ther are few tools to help with fitting the pieces of a complex itinerary together. 

### Access to information

Most trips happen within a context, whether that be the tight schedule of a business trip or the looser requirements of a family holiday. It can be hard for travellers to get access to contextually-relevant answers to the specific questions they have prior to travel.  OTA sites have a range of issues in terms of how representative they are, for reasons discussed elsewhere, and most review sites suffer from a key defect - the information they contain is from travellers who, by definition, lack the local knowledge to provide accurate answers, and may also be speaking from outside the context relevant to the inquirer.

### Feedback loops

Reviews and customer feedback have been almost totally taken over by third-parties. Originally this was with intention of providing verifiable reviews hosted by a neutral party. But it is clear today that those noble aims have not been met. Instead review sites are plagued by fake reviews - since third-parties have proven poor at controlling these and perhaps their incentives are not correctly aligned to do so.  Additionally these neutral parties are almost all far from neutral, themselves being involved in marketing the products they host reviews for in order to earn commissions and fees. Furthermore, travel service providers have had the rights to their own reviews usurped - and as such they cannot make full use of the feedback they receive to market their product.

## Get Involved

The vision for TravelWeft comes from almost 20 years of involvement with travel and technology, and a growing disillusionment with the state of travel tech. If these words strike a chord, please get in touch and and start collaborating in forging a better travel industry - for the future of travel service providers, travellers and the societies they impact.
